=========================

[OpenShift Reference Architecture](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/reference_architectures/2017/html-single/deploying_red_hat_openshift_container_platform_3.5_on_microsoft_azure/) implementation on Azure using Terraform.

Bootstraping
------------
### Setup
Fill in the variables in ```azure.tfvars``` by following the [Terraform docs](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html#creating-credentials):

```
azure_client_id = "xxxxxx-xx-xx-xx-xxxxxxx"  
azure_tenant_id = "xxxxxx-xx-xx-xx-xxxxxxx"  
azure_client_secret = "xxxx"  
azure_subscription_id = "xxxxxx-xx-xx-xx-xxxxxxx"
azure_location = "West Europe"
```

Modify the variables in ```bootstrap.tfvars``` to change the name of the resource group, the number of App nodes, the size of the VMs, the credentials used in the VMs and the domain or subdomain that will be associated with the OpenShift console:

```
resource_group_name = "openshift"
node_count = "2"
node_vm_size = "Standard_A2m_v2"
master_vm_size = "Standard_A2m_v2"
infra_vm_size = "Standard_A2m_v2"
bastion_vm_size = "Standard_A2"
admin_user = "openshift"
admin_password = "xxxxxxxx"
master_domain = "master.mydomain.com"
```

### Bootstrap

Simply run:
```
./bootstrap.sh
```
When finished, you will get the public IPs for the Bastion host and for both the External Load Balancer and the Router Load Balancer.

In order to SSH into the Bastion host use the key in the ```certs``` folder.
